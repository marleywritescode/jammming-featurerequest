# Jammming Feature Request
Differs from original Jammming project by the following features:
-Pressing enter initiates search
-Track information displays album artwork next to name, artist, and album
-Balanced alignment of Results and Playlist panel text so they're even with each other (just for the aesthetics)
-Increased transparency of white bottom-borders to make UI look cleaner
